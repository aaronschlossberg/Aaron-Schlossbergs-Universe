            <strong>Q&A site</strong>: We are in the early stages of developing an innovative question-and-answer (Q&A) platform. Our mission is, "<i>Spreading knowledge, life experiences, and gaining a better understanding of the universe around us</i>". Our goal is to create a space where users can ask and answer questions. And especially with the rise of AI chatbots nowadays, it's important to have a site like this run by <i>real people</i>, because AI cannot foster a community of shared knowledge, expertise, and different perspectives like real people can, and AI is often prone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE;"><u>hallucination</u></a>. And we also will have helpful features, utilize techniques to mitigate trolls and spam, and deploy non-paywall nor heavily ad-reliant site revenue techniques to help keep the site alive. <br><br>

            <strong>Fiction2Reality (F2R)</strong>: <strong style="font-weight: normal">Fiction2Reality</strong> (F2R) is a creative project transforming fictional worlds into real, explorable spaces, starting with a digital stage, creating 3D-rendered models and videos, and ultimately building large-scale physical environments like Hogwarts and the Backrooms. The goal of F2R is to let people step inside the worlds they've only read about or seen on screen, turning imagination into reality. <br><br>

            In places like Harry Potter World at Universal Studios, visitors can only see limited sections of the Hogwarts castle, just the outside and a few decorated rooms, and then there's a ride inside. But F2R envisions something far more immersive: a full, to-scale <em>Hogwarts</em> castle that people can actually explore. Imagine walking through the Great Hall, the Chamber of Secrets, the Room of Requirement, the spiral staircase to the Headmaster's office, or even the witch statue passage to Hogsmeade. Every corridor, secret room, and magical detail—moving stairs, talking portraits, hidden kitchens—would be brought to life as a fully explorable experience. <br><br>

            At the same time, F2R also draws inspiration from 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms" target="_blank" style="color:#0000EE;"><u>The Backrooms</u></a>, a fascinating fictional world that began with one image, and has since evolved into countless 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVAH_MgDVqyDUEg6qDXqORBioE4Yhol_z" target="_blank" style="color:#0000EE;"><u>YouTube videos</u></a>, video games, and stories. These surreal "<em>liminal</em> spaces" have captured people's imaginations worldwide. F2R aims to eventually create a "<em>Backrooms</em>/liminal space" building attraction</em> where visitors can wander and explore, as one part of the project. <br><br>

            Fiction2Reality begins with digital creations: crafting virtual 3D renders, short films, and animated experiences that serve as proofs of concept. As the project builds traction and community support through online platforms and storytelling, F2R plans to evolve into the real-world builds, transforming fictional worlds into physical spaces you can truly step inside. <br>

            <b>YEAN</b>: The <b>Young Entrepreneurs and Aspirers Network (YEAN)</b> is meant to be a professional network for highly motivated young individuals.

            <i>I'm currently a student at Muhlenberg College, where the campus has a vibrant student life with a variety of clubs (known as “Student Organizations”, all run by students). I've had the opportunity to start two of my own clubs, 'co-revive' another, serve on the board of one, and be an active member in several others. Below, I'll be sharing my involvement and leadership roles across these campus organizations. <br> <br>

I formally and officially established the club through a bureaucratic application/presentation process through the college's Student Government Association. I, along with the club's board, organize in-person meetings, for, and about, Pokémon, where we engage in all aspects of the franchise, including the Pokémon video games, the Trading Card Game (TCG), Pokémon Go, Pokémon Showdown, and we even have the original Pokémon board game from the '90s, "<i>Pokémon: Master Trainer</i>", and more. <br>

            <strong>The 'Berg Fencing Club</strong>: <br> 
            I 'co-revived' and run/am the President of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berg.fencing.club/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>'Berg Fencing Club</b></u></a> on campus. The Fencing Club at Muhlenberg has been around for a long time, but after the 2022-2023 academic year, the club's President was a senior and graduated, and nobody took it over, so it wasn't around for a semester. So in the second semester of the 2023-2024 academic year, another fellow student/friend of mine, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansteremberg/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>Ryan Steremberg</b></u></a>, and I 'co-revived' the club; we brought it back, and re-established it. <br><br> 

            In the past, Co-Coach <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-mcandrew-8baa27199/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>Paul McAndrew</b></u></a> would come in to help teach, and the then-President & current Co-Coach, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahnkatz/" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE"><b><u>Noah Katz</b></u></a> (now a Muhlenberg alum, Class of 2023), would also teach those wanting to learn to fence. Ryan reached out to them both near the beginning of the second semester of the 2023-2024 academic year, and both now come to the Fencing Club again to teach those who want to learn. <br><br>

            For the Fencing Club, we provide the gear (owned by the club/the college), and we teach fencing, starting with the basics. So, no equipment or experience is needed in order to join the club. It is a low-stakes, high-fun way to learn how to fence, and to fence with others! <br>
