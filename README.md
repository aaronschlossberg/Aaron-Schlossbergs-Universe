## Goals & Future Improvements
- Further enhance the visual design and layout with additional HTML and advanced CSS.
- Add interactive elements using more JavaScript. 
- Continue to improve the formatting.
- Add more pages (and perhaps some subdomains, as well). 
  - /resume/
  - /compendium/
  - /art/
  - /picturesofme/ or images.aaronschlossberg.com (split up into pages) 
  - favoritequotes.aaronschlossberg.com (split into pages and sections) 
  - "for recruiters" page, with an embedded résumé, project summaries, skills, contact, links to GitHub, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc...
  - /interests/ 
  - /fandoms/ 
  - /videos/ 
  - "a view of the real world"/"formative experiences" (or whatever it will be called) 
  - /referrals/ 
  - /aaronstravels/ 
  - /writing/ 
  - 
- Embed a Google Maps map.
- Move "clubs/student organizations" stuff into new linked page to have more focus on the projects and ventures, and to have less all on one page. (And also my clubs/student orgs will be less relevant after college.) 
- Link to other websites I've built.

## Notes!
This site is a _work-in-progress_, and will continue to evolve as I improve my front-end development skills. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
