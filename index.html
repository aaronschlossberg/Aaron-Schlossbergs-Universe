        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <strong style="font-weight: normal">Aaron</strong> is an aspiring <strong>computer scientist</strong>, <strong>entrepreneur</strong>, and <strong>writer</strong>, and somewhat of a <strong style="font-weight: normal";><i>multipotentialite</i></strong>, who is interested in how technology & knowledge can help make our and other's lives easier and improve the world around us. He also enjoys writing, reading books, watching movies & TV shows, playing video games, and listening to music, among other activities. He embraces experimentation and more of an organized "<i>throw things at the wall to see what sticks</i>" approach, knowing that through persistence, at least one venture, or perhaps multiple, will succeed, allowing him to build the future that he envisions. He wants to create a meaningful impact; whether that's through innovation, technology, or ambitious, world-changing projects.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            Academically, <strong style="font-weight: normal">Aaron has always sought out learning environments that push boundaries</strong>. He attended a dual-curriculum elementary and middle school, followed by a high school, <a href="https://www.hartfordschools.org/o/pathways" target="_blank"><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Pathways Academy of Technology and Design</strong></a>, with a strong focus on both technology and the arts. There, he took courses such as "<i>Fundamentals of Design</i>" (an introduction to various traditional art types), "<i>Video Game Design</i>", "<i>Programming</i>", "<i>Digital Video & Media</i>", "<i>Digital Music</i>", "<i>Graphic Design</i>", "<i>Immersive Game Environments</i>", "<i>Innovation & Invention</i>", "<i>Automation & Robotics</i>", and "<i>AP Computer Science</i>". This early exposure to interdisciplinary learning helped fuel his passion for technology, entrepreneurship, and creativity. <br><br>
        
            Now, at <a href="https://www.muhlenberg.edu/" target="_blank"><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Muhlenberg College</strong></a>, he is majoring in <i><strong style="font-weight: normal";></strong>Computer Science</strong></i> with minors in <i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Innovation & Entrepreneurship</strong></i> (INE) and <i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Studio Art</strong></i>. He is involved in on-campus Student Organizations/"clubs", has started some of his own, and has cultivated a vibrant social and academic life. His coursework has included subjects like "<i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Intro to Game Programming</strong></i>", "<i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Machine Learning</strong></i>", "<i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Software Engineering</strong></i>", "<i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Data Structures & Algorithms</strong></i>", "<i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Web Software Development</strong></i>", "<i><strong style="font-weight: normal";>Database Systems</strong></i>", multiple INE classes, multiple art courses, a course about <strong style="font-weight: normal";>Japan</strong> that doubled in <strong style="font-weight: normal";>Ecology and Religion</strong>, and culminated in a two-week trip <i>to</i> Japan. He constantly seeks opportunities to apply what he learns, whether through independent projects or real-world experiences. <br>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond business and technology, he has a profound desire to create meaningful change. He wants to contribute to solving global issues such as hunger and homelessness, while also working toward advancements like radical longevity. He doesn't concern himself with ideological debates or rigid political labels — he simply wants to <i>do what's right</i>. These lyrics of <i>Fly Like an Eagle</i> by Steve Miller Band resonate deeply with him: <br>

            <blockquote>
                "<i>I want to feed the babies <br>
                Who can't get enough to eat <br>
                I want to shoe the children <br>
                New shoes on their feet <br>
                I want to house the people <br>
                Living in the street <br>
                Oh, there, there's a solution...</i>" 
            </blockquote> <br>

            ...He wants to help those who don't have enough to eat, provide shoes for those who have none, provide shelter to those without a home, and improve peoples lives in other tangible ways. Instead of getting caught up in debates over "<i>who is <b>right</b></i>" vs "<i>who is <b>wrong</b></i>"... his focus is on taking action and creating solutions; <b>just <i>DOING</i> what's right</b>! <br><br>

            Ultimately, he lives by these words of Alan Kay: "<i>The best way to predict the future is to invent it</i>." Aaron's overarching goal is simple yet ambitious: "<b>I want to leave the world at least 1% better than I joined it</b>." And through his <strong style="font-weight: normal";>entrepreneurial ventures</strong>, creative projects, and constant drive to innovate, he is determined and motivated to make that happen.
